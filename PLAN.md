## Technologies to Use

### **Backend**
- **ElysiaJS** for API and WebSocket server.
- **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for database storage (user data, messages, servers).
- **Redis** for caching and pub/sub (real-time updates).
- **Bun** runtime for fast execution and low latency.

### **Frontend**
- **React**, **Vue**, or **Svelte** for the web app.
- Use **Next.js** for server-side rendering (SSR) if using React.

### **Mobile App**
- **React Native** for building cross-platform mobile apps.
- Integrate WebSockets for real-time messaging.

### **Voice and Video**
- **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer voice/video communication.
- Use a signaling server (with ElysiaJS) to initiate WebRTC connections.

### **Phase 2: Servers and Channels**
- Allow users to create servers and invite others.
- Implement text channels and role-based permissions.
- Add basic server management tools (create/delete channels).

### **Phase 3: File Sharing and Media Previews**
- Add file upload functionality with Bun's file handling.
- Generate previews for images and links (using metadata parsing).

### **Phase 4: Voice Chat**
- Integrate WebRTC for real-time voice communication.
- Implement voice channels with dynamic user lists.

### **Phase 5: Notifications and Polishing**
